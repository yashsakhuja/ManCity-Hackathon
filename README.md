# ManCity-Hays and CodeCo Hackathon
Our team has worked on an Expected Points model and Evidential Reasoning Model for women's premier league data provided by Statsbomb and Second Spectrum.

Aim: To identify top players by devising new scoring methods to score the individual performances. 
Data Source: Statsbomb and SecondSpectrum

About Expected Points Model:

About Evidential Reasoning Model: 

The Evidential Reasoning Model is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory for modelling uncertainities and possibilities.
Using this model we have made an attempt to use a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis model for scoring and prescribing best defensive measures based on defensive attributes (metrics) based on our domain knowledge. We have made use of the Intelligent Decision System (IDS) software designed by Prof. Jian Bo-Yang of the University of Manchester. 

To know more about this theory and its applications we attach here an academic paper by the professor himself:
